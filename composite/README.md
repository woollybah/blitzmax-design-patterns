# Composite

## Intent
Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole
hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions
of objects uniformly.

## Applicability
Use the Composite pattern when

* you want to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects
* you want clients to be able to ignore the difference between compositions of objects and individual objects. Clients will treat all objects in the composite structure uniformly
