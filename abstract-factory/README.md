# Abstract Factory

## Also known as
Kit

## Intent
Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent
objects without specifying their concrete classes.

![alt text](./doc/abstract-factory.png "Abstract Factory")

## Applicability
Use the Abstract Factory pattern when

* a system should be independent of how its products are created, composed and represented
* a system should be configured with one of multiple families of products
* a family of related product objects is designed to be used together, and you need to enforce this constraint
* you want to provide a class library of products, and you want to reveal just their interfaces, not their implementations
