# Builder

## Intent
Separate the construction of a complex object from its
representation so that the same construction process can create different
representations.

## Applicability
Use the Builder pattern when

* the algorithm for creating a complex object should be independent of the parts that make up the object and how they're assembled
* the construction process must allow different representations for the object that's constructed
